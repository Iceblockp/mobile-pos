# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing data export and import functionality by removing the limited product-specific export/import from ProductsManager.tsx and creating a comprehensive, user-friendly data management system in the dedicated data-export and data-import pages. The system will provide granular control over what data to export/import, with clear UX flows and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to remove the product-specific export/import functionality from the inventory management screen, so that all data management is centralized in dedicated pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the ProductsManager component THEN I SHALL NOT see export or import buttons for products
2. WHEN I access the inventory screen THEN I SHALL only see product management functions (add, edit, delete, search, sort)
3. WHEN I need to export or import product data THEN I SHALL be directed to use the dedicated data-export and data-import pages
4. IF I previously used product export/import from ProductsManager THEN I SHALL find equivalent functionality in the dedicated pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a comprehensive data export system that allows me to choose specific data types or export everything, so that I can create targeted backups or complete system backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the data export page THEN I SHALL see options to export individual data types (products, sales, customers, expenses, etc.)
2. WHEN I select a data type THEN I SHALL see a clear description of what data will be included
3. WHEN I choose "Complete Backup" THEN I SHALL export all available data types in a single file
4. WHEN I export data THEN I SHALL see progress indicators and clear success/error messages
5. WHEN export completes THEN I SHALL be able to share or save the exported file
6. IF an export fails THEN I SHALL see specific error messages explaining what went wrong

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a comprehensive data import system that allows me to selectively import different types of data, so that I can restore specific parts of my business data or perform complete system restoration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the data import page THEN I SHALL see options to import different data types
2. WHEN I select an import option THEN I SHALL be prompted to choose a compatible JSON file
3. WHEN I import data THEN I SHALL see validation checks to ensure data compatibility
4. WHEN importing THEN I SHALL see progress indicators showing current stage and completion percentage
5. WHEN import completes THEN I SHALL see a summary of imported, updated, and skipped records
6. IF import data conflicts with existing data THEN I SHALL see clear conflict resolution options
7. IF an import fails THEN I SHALL see specific error messages and rollback information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want selective data export options, so that I can export only the data I need for specific purposes (like sharing product catalogs or sales reports).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I export products THEN I SHALL include categories, suppliers, and bulk pricing information
2. WHEN I export sales THEN I SHALL include sale items, customer information, and payment details
3. WHEN I export customers THEN I SHALL include purchase history and statistics
4. WHEN I export expenses THEN I SHALL include expense categories and detailed transaction data
5. WHEN I export stock movements THEN I SHALL include product references and supplier information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a simple and intuitive user interface for data management, so that I can easily understand and use the export/import features without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view export/import options THEN I SHALL see clear icons, titles, and descriptions for each data type
2. WHEN I perform export/import operations THEN I SHALL see progress bars and status messages
3. WHEN operations complete THEN I SHALL see clear success confirmations with action summaries
4. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL see user-friendly error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN I need help THEN I SHALL find informational sections explaining the features
6. IF I'm unsure about an operation THEN I SHALL see confirmation dialogs before destructive actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want data validation and integrity checks during import, so that I can ensure imported data doesn't corrupt my existing business data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import data THEN I SHALL see validation checks for data format and structure
2. WHEN importing products THEN I SHALL see checks for required fields (name, price, category)
3. WHEN importing sales THEN I SHALL see validation for positive amounts and valid dates
4. WHEN importing customers THEN I SHALL see duplicate detection based on name or phone
5. WHEN duplicate data is found THEN I SHALL see options to update existing data with imported data or skip the duplicate
6. WHEN data validation fails THEN I SHALL see specific error messages for each validation failure
7. IF imported data has missing references THEN I SHALL see options to skip or create default values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want batch processing and performance optimization for large data imports, so that I can import substantial amounts of data without app crashes or timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import large datasets THEN I SHALL see batch processing with configurable batch sizes
2. WHEN processing batches THEN I SHALL see real-time progress updates
3. WHEN import takes time THEN I SHALL see estimated completion times
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN I SHALL see automatic memory management and cleanup
5. IF import is interrupted THEN I SHALL see options to resume from the last successful batch
6. WHEN import completes THEN I SHALL see performance metrics (time taken, records processed)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery options, so that I can resolve issues and complete data operations successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur during export THEN I SHALL see specific error messages with suggested fixes
2. WHEN errors occur during import THEN I SHALL see rollback options to restore previous state
3. WHEN network issues affect operations THEN I SHALL see retry options with exponential backoff
4. WHEN file format is incorrect THEN I SHALL see clear format requirements and examples
5. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN I SHALL see conflict resolution options
6. IF operations fail partially THEN I SHALL see detailed reports of successful and failed items
