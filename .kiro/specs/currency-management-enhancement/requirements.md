# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the enhancement of the currency management system to provide a unified, consistent, and user-friendly currency experience across the entire application. The current system has partial currency support but lacks full integration with shop settings storage, consistent UI implementation, and comprehensive custom currency features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Currency Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want my currency settings to be stored consistently with other shop settings in AsyncStorage, so that all my shop configuration is managed in one place and persists reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure currency settings THEN they SHALL be stored in AsyncStorage as part of shop settings
2. WHEN the app initializes THEN currency settings SHALL be loaded from shop settings storage
3. WHEN I update currency settings THEN both the currency manager and shop settings SHALL be updated synchronously
4. WHEN I export shop settings THEN currency configuration SHALL be included in the export
5. WHEN I import shop settings THEN currency configuration SHALL be restored correctly
6. WHEN currency settings are corrupted THEN the system SHALL fallback to default MMK currency

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Currency Selector with Custom Currency Support

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want to easily select from predefined currencies or create custom currencies through an intuitive interface, so that I can configure my shop to work with any currency I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the currency selector THEN I SHALL see all predefined currencies with clear formatting examples
2. WHEN I select a predefined currency THEN it SHALL be applied immediately with confirmation
3. WHEN I choose "Custom Currency" THEN I SHALL see a form to create a new currency
4. WHEN creating a custom currency THEN I SHALL be able to specify code, name, symbol, decimal places, and formatting rules
5. WHEN I create a custom currency THEN it SHALL be validated and saved for future use
6. WHEN I view currency options THEN I SHALL see a preview of how prices will be formatted

### Requirement 3: Consistent Currency UI Across All Pages

**User Story:** As a user, I want all price displays throughout the app to use the same currency formatting and symbols, so that the experience is consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing product prices THEN they SHALL use the configured currency format consistently
2. WHEN processing sales THEN all price displays SHALL use the same currency formatting
3. WHEN viewing reports and analytics THEN currency formatting SHALL be consistent
4. WHEN printing receipts THEN currency formatting SHALL match the configured settings
5. WHEN viewing supplier costs THEN currency formatting SHALL be consistent with other prices
6. WHEN displaying bulk pricing tiers THEN currency formatting SHALL be uniform

### Requirement 4: Currency Context and Hook Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized currency context and hooks system, so that all components can easily access and use currency formatting consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components need currency formatting THEN they SHALL use the centralized currency hook
2. WHEN currency settings change THEN all components SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN components display prices THEN they SHALL use the standard formatting functions
4. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL easily integrate with the currency system
5. WHEN currency operations fail THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be provided

### Requirement 5: Currency Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear validation and error messages when configuring currency settings, so that I can avoid mistakes and understand any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering invalid currency codes THEN I SHALL see clear validation messages
2. WHEN creating conflicting separator settings THEN I SHALL be warned about the conflict
3. WHEN currency operations fail THEN I SHALL see helpful error messages
4. WHEN importing invalid currency data THEN I SHALL see specific validation errors
5. WHEN currency settings are corrupted THEN I SHALL be notified and offered recovery options

### Requirement 6: Currency Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current currency settings to be preserved and migrated properly when the enhanced system is implemented, so that I don't lose my configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading to the enhanced currency system THEN existing currency settings SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN old currency data exists THEN it SHALL be migrated to the new storage format
3. WHEN migration occurs THEN no currency formatting SHALL be lost or corrupted
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options
5. WHEN using legacy currency data THEN it SHALL be automatically upgraded to the new format

### Requirement 7: Currency Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want currency formatting to be fast and efficient, so that it doesn't impact the app's performance during sales or data display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting many prices THEN performance SHALL remain smooth and responsive
2. WHEN currency settings change THEN updates SHALL be efficient and not cause lag
3. WHEN displaying large lists with prices THEN scrolling SHALL remain smooth
4. WHEN processing sales THEN currency calculations SHALL not cause delays
5. WHEN generating reports THEN currency formatting SHALL not impact report generation speed

### Requirement 8: Currency Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the currency system, so that currency functionality is reliable and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN currency formatting functions are called THEN they SHALL be covered by unit tests
2. WHEN currency settings are changed THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper updates
3. WHEN currency validation occurs THEN edge cases SHALL be tested
4. WHEN currency migration runs THEN it SHALL be tested with various data scenarios
5. WHEN currency UI components are used THEN they SHALL have component tests

### Requirement 9: Currency Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want clear documentation and examples for the currency system, so that I can understand how to use and maintain it properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing currency features THEN clear code examples SHALL be available
2. WHEN configuring currencies THEN user documentation SHALL explain all options
3. WHEN troubleshooting currency issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available
4. WHEN extending currency functionality THEN developer guides SHALL be provided
5. WHEN training users THEN step-by-step guides SHALL be available

### Requirement 10: Currency Analytics and Reporting Integration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want currency information to be properly integrated into analytics and reports, so that financial data is accurate and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating sales reports THEN currency totals SHALL be formatted correctly
2. WHEN viewing profit analytics THEN currency calculations SHALL be accurate
3. WHEN comparing periods THEN currency formatting SHALL be consistent
4. WHEN exporting financial data THEN currency information SHALL be preserved
