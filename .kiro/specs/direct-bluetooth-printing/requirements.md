# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds direct Bluetooth thermal printing capability to the POS app, specifically for the Xprinter P300 thermal printer. The goal is to enable one-tap printing without external apps, while keeping the implementation simple and reliable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a shop owner with an Xprinter P300 thermal printer, I want to print receipts directly from the app via Bluetooth, so that I can have a fast, seamless printing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a sale THEN the system SHALL provide a "Print Direct" option
2. WHEN I tap "Print Direct" THEN the system SHALL connect to my paired Xprinter P300
3. WHEN printing directly THEN the receipt SHALL print immediately without external apps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user setting up thermal printing, I want to easily find and connect to my Xprinter P300, so that I can start printing without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access printer settings THEN the system SHALL scan for available Bluetooth printers
2. WHEN my Xprinter P300 is found THEN the system SHALL allow me to pair and save it
3. WHEN printer is paired THEN the system SHALL remember it for future printing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a shop owner, I want my existing receipt templates to work with direct printing, so that I maintain consistent branding and formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN printing directly THEN the system SHALL use my existing shop settings (name, logo, etc.)
2. WHEN converting to thermal format THEN the system SHALL maintain readable text and proper spacing
3. WHEN thermal printing fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to the existing PDF sharing method
