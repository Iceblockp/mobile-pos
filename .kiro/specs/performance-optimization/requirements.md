# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the application's performance when handling large product datasets (1000-10000 products). The current system experiences performance degradation during quick actions in sales and product management screens. The optimization focuses on simple modifications to the current flow without introducing complex new features.

## Glossary

- **Database_Service**: The SQLite-based service that handles all data operations
- **Infinite_Query**: React Query's useInfiniteQuery hook for paginated data loading
- **Product_List**: The main product listing component that displays products with infinite scroll
- **Sales_Screen**: The screen where users add products to cart during sales transactions
- **Inventory_Screen**: The screen where users manage product inventory
- **Barcode_Scanner**: Component that scans barcodes for immediate product search
- **Bulk_Pricing_Badge**: Simple indicator showing if a product has bulk pricing tiers
- **Debounced_Search**: Search input with delayed execution to prevent excessive queries

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Pagination and Search

**User Story:** As a shop owner with thousands of products, I want the app to load products in small batches, so that the initial screen loads quickly and I can scroll to see more products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Product_List loads, THE Database_Service SHALL return paginated results with 50 products per page
2. WHEN searching products, THE Database_Service SHALL support search by name and barcode with pagination
3. WHEN filtering by category, THE Database_Service SHALL combine category filter with search and pagination
4. WHERE barcode search is performed, THE Database_Service SHALL use exact match for immediate results
5. WHILE maintaining current functionality, THE Database_Service SHALL add proper database indexes for performance

### Requirement 2: Infinite Scroll Implementation

**User Story:** As a user browsing products, I want to see more products automatically when I scroll to the bottom, so that I don't have to manually load more pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling to the bottom of Product_List, THE Infinite_Query SHALL automatically fetch the next page
2. WHEN new data is loaded, THE Product_List SHALL append new products to the existing list
3. WHEN loading next page, THE Product_List SHALL show a loading indicator at the bottom
4. WHERE no more products exist, THE Product_List SHALL not attempt to load additional pages
5. WHILE scrolling, THE Product_List SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance

### Requirement 3: Sales Screen Optimization

**User Story:** As a cashier making quick sales, I want to search and add products to cart instantly, so that I can serve customers efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Sales_Screen, THE Product_List SHALL use the same infinite scroll pattern
2. WHEN scanning a barcode on Sales_Screen, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL immediately search and add product to cart
3. WHEN searching manually on Sales_Screen, THE Product_List SHALL show products with bulk pricing indicators
4. WHERE bulk pricing exists, THE Bulk_Pricing_Badge SHALL display "Bulk" indicator on product cards
5. WHILE adding products to cart, THE Sales_Screen SHALL maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 4: Inventory Screen Search

**User Story:** As a shop manager updating inventory, I want to find products immediately when I scan their barcode, so that I can quickly update stock levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning barcode on Inventory_Screen, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL immediately search and highlight the product
2. WHEN typing in search, THE Debounced_Search SHALL wait 300ms before executing search
3. WHEN search results appear, THE Product_List SHALL highlight matching terms
4. WHERE product is found by barcode, THE Inventory_Screen SHALL scroll to and highlight the product
5. WHILE searching, THE Product_List SHALL maintain current filter and category selections

### Requirement 5: Component Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the app, I want smooth and responsive UI, so that the app feels fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering product cards, THE Product_List SHALL use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN calculating product profit, THE Product_List SHALL use useMemo to cache calculations
3. WHEN search input changes, THE Debounced_Search SHALL use useDeferredValue to delay updates
4. WHERE bulk pricing exists, THE Bulk_Pricing_Badge SHALL show simple "Bulk" text instead of detailed tiers
5. WHILE scrolling through products, THE Product_List SHALL use FlatList performance optimizations

### Requirement 6: Database Index Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database queries to execute quickly, so that users don't experience delays when searching or loading products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying products by name, THE Database_Service SHALL use indexed search for fast results
2. WHEN searching by barcode, THE Database_Service SHALL use indexed lookup for instant results
3. WHEN filtering by category, THE Database_Service SHALL use category_id index
4. WHERE date-based sorting is used, THE Database_Service SHALL use updated_at index
5. WHILE maintaining data integrity, THE Database_Service SHALL create composite indexes for complex queries

### Requirement 7: Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user with limited device memory, I want the app to use memory efficiently, so that it doesn't slow down my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading product images, THE Product_List SHALL limit concurrent image loads to 10
2. WHEN caching query results, THE Infinite_Query SHALL use appropriate stale time and garbage collection
3. WHEN component unmounts, THE Product_List SHALL clean up event listeners and subscriptions
4. WHERE large datasets are processed, THE Database_Service SHALL process data in batches
5. WHILE maintaining performance, THE Product_List SHALL remove off-screen components from memory

### Requirement 8: Barcode Integration

**User Story:** As a user scanning products, I want immediate results when I scan a barcode, so that I can quickly find or add products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN barcode is scanned on Sales_Screen, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL immediately add product to cart if found
2. WHEN barcode is scanned on Inventory_Screen, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL immediately search and highlight product
3. WHEN barcode is not found, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL show appropriate error message
4. WHERE multiple products have same barcode, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL show selection dialog
5. WHILE scanning, THE Barcode_Scanner SHALL provide visual feedback for successful scans
