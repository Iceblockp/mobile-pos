# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Analytics Modernization feature updates the existing AI chat analytics functionality to use the modern `@google/genai` library instead of the deprecated manual fetch-based Gemini API implementation. This modernization will simplify the codebase, improve maintainability, and ensure compatibility with the latest Google AI SDK while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the modern `@google/genai` library, so that the AI analytics code is cleaner, more maintainable, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI analytics service makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the `@google/genai` library instead of manual fetch requests
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include `@google/genai` package in package.json
3. WHEN initializing the AI service THEN it SHALL use `GoogleGenAI` constructor with proper API key configuration
4. WHEN making requests THEN it SHALL use the library's built-in methods instead of custom HTTP handling
5. The modernized implementation SHALL be simpler and more readable than the current fetch-based approach

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a shop owner, I want all existing AI analytics functionality to work exactly the same, so that I don't lose any features during the modernization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asking questions THEN the system SHALL provide the same quality of responses as before
2. WHEN using default questions THEN they SHALL work identically to the current implementation
3. WHEN viewing chat history THEN it SHALL display messages in the same format as before
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL show the same error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN configuring API keys THEN the setup process SHALL remain unchanged for users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling through the library's built-in mechanisms, so that error management is more robust and standardized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL use the library's native error handling instead of custom error parsing
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL leverage the library's built-in retry mechanisms where available
3. WHEN invalid API keys are used THEN the system SHALL handle library-specific error types appropriately
4. WHEN timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL use the library's timeout handling or implement compatible timeout logic
5. The error handling SHALL be more reliable and consistent than the current manual implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove deprecated API endpoint configurations, so that the codebase is future-proof and follows current Google AI standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the AI service THEN it SHALL NOT use hardcoded API endpoints from the old implementation
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the library's default endpoints and configurations
3. WHEN updating configurations THEN deprecated config options SHALL be removed from the codebase
4. WHEN the library updates THEN the implementation SHALL be compatible with future library versions
5. The configuration SHALL be simplified compared to the current manual endpoint management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cleaner request formatting, so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting AI requests THEN the system SHALL use the library's native request structure
2. WHEN setting generation parameters THEN it SHALL use the library's configuration objects instead of manual JSON construction
3. WHEN handling responses THEN it SHALL use the library's response parsing instead of manual JSON parsing
4. WHEN preparing prompts THEN the code SHALL be more readable and follow library conventions
5. The request/response handling SHALL require less boilerplate code than the current implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with existing data formats, so that no data migration is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing shop data THEN the system SHALL use the same data export format as before
2. WHEN storing API keys THEN it SHALL use the same AsyncStorage keys and encryption as the current implementation
3. WHEN managing chat history THEN it SHALL maintain the same message format and storage structure
4. WHEN handling responses THEN the output format SHALL remain compatible with existing UI components
5. The modernization SHALL NOT require any database schema changes or data migrations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of the modernized implementation, so that I can be confident the changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all existing AI analytics tests SHALL pass with the new implementation
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the modernized service SHALL integrate properly with existing components
3. WHEN performing E2E tests THEN the complete user workflow SHALL function identically to before
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN all error handling paths SHALL work correctly with the new library
5. The test suite SHALL include specific tests for the `@google/genai` library integration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation and code comments, so that the modernized implementation is well-documented and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing service code THEN it SHALL include updated comments explaining the library usage
2. WHEN checking type definitions THEN they SHALL reflect the new library's interfaces where applicable
3. WHEN reading configuration files THEN they SHALL have updated comments about the modernized approach
4. WHEN examining error handling THEN it SHALL be documented how library errors are handled
5. The code SHALL be self-documenting and easier to understand than the previous implementation
