# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing POS system database to include advanced inventory management, customer relationship management, and bulk operations features. The enhancements will add customers table, stock movement tracking, bulk pricing features, and improve the existing suppliers and products tables to support optional relationships and better data flexibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Supplier Management

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want suppliers to have optional email addresses and products to have optional supplier relationships, so that I can manage products that don't have specific suppliers and suppliers without email contacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or updating a supplier THEN the email field SHALL be optional
2. WHEN creating or updating a product THEN the supplier_id field SHALL be optional
3. IF a product has no supplier THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully in all UI components
4. WHEN displaying supplier information THEN missing email addresses SHALL be handled appropriately

### Requirement 2: Customer Management System

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want to track customer information and associate sales with customers, so that I can build customer relationships and analyze customer purchasing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a customer THEN the system SHALL store name, phone, email (optional), and address (optional)
2. WHEN processing a sale THEN the customer association SHALL be optional
3. WHEN viewing sales history THEN I SHALL be able to filter by customer
4. WHEN viewing customer details THEN I SHALL see their purchase history and total spent
5. IF a sale has no customer THEN it SHALL be treated as a walk-in customer sale

### Requirement 3: Stock Movement Tracking

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to track stock additions from suppliers and manual stock removals (expired/damaged products), so that I can monitor inventory changes, identify discrepancies, and maintain accurate stock levels separate from sales tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stock is added from suppliers THEN the system SHALL record a stock movement entry with type "stock_in"
2. WHEN stock is removed manually (expired, damaged, etc.) THEN the system SHALL record a stock movement entry with type "stock_out"
3. WHEN viewing stock movements THEN I SHALL see date, product, quantity, type, reason, and supplier reference (for stock_in)
4. WHEN adjusting stock manually THEN I SHALL be able to provide a reason for the adjustment
5. WHEN viewing product details THEN I SHALL see both stock movement history AND sales history separately
6. WHEN sales occur THEN they SHALL NOT create stock movement entries (tracked separately through sales records)

### Requirement 4: Bulk Pricing Features

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want to set up bulk pricing for products, so that I can offer discounts for quantity purchases and increase sales volume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a product THEN I SHALL be able to define bulk price tiers
2. WHEN a bulk price tier is defined THEN it SHALL include minimum quantity and discounted price
3. WHEN processing a sale THEN the system SHALL automatically apply bulk pricing if quantity thresholds are met
4. WHEN viewing product information THEN bulk pricing tiers SHALL be clearly displayed
5. IF multiple bulk tiers apply THEN the system SHALL use the best available price for the customer

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Sales Processing for Bulk Operations

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want the system to automatically calculate bulk discounts during sales, so that customers receive appropriate pricing without manual calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding items to cart THEN the system SHALL check for applicable bulk pricing
2. WHEN bulk pricing applies THEN the system SHALL display the original price and bulk discount
3. WHEN processing payment THEN the final total SHALL reflect all bulk discounts applied
4. WHEN printing receipts THEN bulk discounts SHALL be clearly itemized
5. WHEN viewing sale history THEN bulk discounts SHALL be preserved and visible

### Requirement 6: Clean and Simple User Interface Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new features to integrate seamlessly into the existing clean interface design without adding complexity or clutter, so that the app remains easy to use and navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL follow the existing design patterns and navigation structure
2. WHEN managing customers THEN the interface SHALL be simple and not overcomplicate the existing flow
3. WHEN accessing stock movements THEN they SHALL be integrated into existing inventory views without creating new complex screens
4. WHEN setting up bulk pricing THEN it SHALL be part of the existing product form without making it overwhelming
5. WHEN processing sales THEN customer selection SHALL be optional and unobtrusive to the current sales flow
6. WHEN navigating between features THEN the app architecture SHALL remain clear and logical

### Requirement 7: Database Migration and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all database changes to be applied safely with proper migrations, so that existing data is preserved and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading the database THEN existing data SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN adding new tables THEN they SHALL be created with proper indexes and constraints
3. WHEN modifying existing tables THEN changes SHALL be applied through safe migrations
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous state
5. WHEN foreign key constraints are optional THEN they SHALL allow NULL values appropriately

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want the enhanced system to maintain good performance even with large amounts of customer and stock movement data, so that daily operations remain efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying stock movements THEN results SHALL be paginated for large datasets
2. WHEN searching customers THEN search SHALL be fast and responsive
3. WHEN calculating bulk pricing THEN performance SHALL not impact cart operations
4. WHEN generating reports THEN large datasets SHALL be handled efficiently
5. WHEN displaying product lists THEN bulk pricing information SHALL load without delays

### Requirement 9: Data Export and Import

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want to export and import customer data and stock movement reports, so that I can backup data and integrate with external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting customer data THEN it SHALL include purchase history and totals
2. WHEN importing customer data THEN existing customers SHALL be updated appropriately
3. WHEN exporting stock movements THEN it SHALL include all movement types and details
4. WHEN exporting products THEN bulk pricing information SHALL be included
5. IF import data conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options

### Requirement 10: Analytics and Reporting Enhancement
