# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the addition of supplier management UI and the conversion of price-related properties from integer to decimal format to support both whole number pricing (Myanmar Kyat) and decimal pricing (other currencies). The enhancements will provide a complete supplier management interface and flexible pricing system that can handle various currency formats.

6. WHEN calculating bulk pricing THEN decimal discounts SHALL be applied correctly

### Requirement 4: Database Migration for Decimal Pricing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing integer price data to be safely converted to decimal format, so that current data is preserved while enabling decimal price support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading the database THEN existing integer prices SHALL be converted to decimal format
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN all price-related fields SHALL support decimal values
