# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical React infinite loop error occurring in the `ProductMovementHistory` component when users type in price and cost input fields. The error "Maximum update depth exceeded" indicates that components are repeatedly calling setState, creating an infinite re-render cycle. This issue prevents users from properly entering price data in product creation modals and other forms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to type in price and cost input fields without encountering React infinite loop errors, so that I can successfully create and edit products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in any price input field THEN the component SHALL NOT trigger infinite re-renders
2. WHEN a user opens the product create modal THEN the ProductMovementHistory component SHALL render without errors
3. WHEN a user types in price or cost inputs THEN the input SHALL update smoothly without performance issues
4. WHEN price validation occurs THEN it SHALL NOT cause circular useEffect dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PriceInput component to have stable state management, so that it doesn't cause cascading re-render issues in parent components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PriceInput component receives external value changes THEN it SHALL update without triggering circular effects
2. WHEN the PriceInput component's internal state changes THEN it SHALL notify parent components without causing infinite loops
3. WHEN multiple PriceInput components are used in the same form THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with each other's state updates
4. WHEN the component unmounts and remounts THEN it SHALL initialize properly without triggering unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain responsive and stable when working with price inputs, so that I can efficiently manage my inventory and sales data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using price inputs in any form THEN the application SHALL maintain smooth performance
2. WHEN switching between different input fields THEN there SHALL be no lag or freezing
3. WHEN the ProductMovementHistory component is displayed THEN it SHALL load without blocking the UI
4. WHEN price formatting occurs THEN it SHALL happen efficiently without causing performance degradation
