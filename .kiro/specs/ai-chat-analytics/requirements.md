# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Chat Analytics feature provides Myanmar shop owners with an intuitive, conversational interface to analyze their business data using AI. This feature integrates with the existing POS system's SQLite database and uses external AI APIs (like Gemini) to provide intelligent insights through a simple chat interface. The feature will be accessible as a third tab in the Reports section, alongside the existing Overview and Customer tabs.

4. WHEN the user submits a question THEN the system SHALL process the question and display a loading indicator
5. WHEN the AI response is received THEN the system SHALL display the response in a well-formatted, readable manner

### Requirement 3

5. WHEN the database is empty THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no data is available for analysis

### Requirement 4

### Requirement 6
