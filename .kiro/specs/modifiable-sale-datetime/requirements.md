# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a simple date/time display and modification capability to the sales interface. Users can see the current time and optionally modify it before creating a sale. The default behavior remains unchanged - sales use the current time unless specifically modified.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want to see the current date and time when creating a sale, so that I know when the transaction will be recorded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the sales cart THEN the system SHALL display the current date and time in a small, compact format
2. WHEN the sales interface loads THEN the displayed time SHALL default to the current system time
3. WHEN the time is displayed THEN it SHALL be formatted simply (e.g., "Dec 10, 2025 2:30 PM")

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want to modify the sale date and time when needed, so that I can record sales with a different timestamp.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap on the time display THEN the system SHALL open a date/time picker
2. WHEN I select a new date and time THEN the display SHALL update to show the selected time
3. WHEN I don't modify the time THEN the sale SHALL use the current system time
4. WHEN I modify the time THEN the sale SHALL use the selected time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a store employee, I want the feature to be simple and not interfere with normal sales, so that it doesn't slow down the checkout process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing normal sales THEN I SHALL be able to ignore the time display completely
2. WHEN the time display is shown THEN it SHALL not take up significant screen space
3. WHEN I tap the time accidentally THEN I SHALL be able to cancel without affecting the sale
4. WHEN the date/time picker opens THEN it SHALL be easy to close without making changes
