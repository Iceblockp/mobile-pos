# Dashboard Daily Charts Implementation

## Overview

Added daily sales and expense bar charts to the dashboard showing current month data with day-by-day breakdown.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Methods**

Added two new methods to `DatabaseService`:

#### `getDailySalesForCurrentMonth()`

- Fetches daily sales data for the current month
- Groups sales by day using SQLite date functions
- Fills in missing days with 0 values
- Returns labels (day numbers) and data (sales amounts)

#### `getDailyExpensesForCurrentMonth()`

- Fetches daily expense data for the current month
- Groups expenses by day using SQLite date functions
- Fills in missing days with 0 values
- Returns labels (day numbers) and data (expense amounts)

### 2. **Dashboard Hook Enhancement**

Updated `useDashboardAnalytics()` hook to include:

- `dailySalesChart` - Daily sales data for current month
- `dailyExpensesChart` - Daily expense data for current month

### 3. **Dashboard UI Updates**

Added two bar charts to the dashboard:

#### Daily Sales Chart

- Shows daily sales for current month
- Title includes current month and year
- Y-axis formatted as currency
- Footer shows total sales for the month
- Uses `CustomBarChart` component

#### Daily Expenses Chart

- Shows daily expenses for current month
- Title includes current month and year
- Y-axis formatted as currency
- Footer shows total expenses for the month
- Uses `CustomBarChart` component

### 4. **Localization**

Added new translation keys:

- `dashboard.dailySales` - "Daily Sales" / "နေ့စဉ်ရောင်းချမှု"
- `dashboard.dailyExpenses` - "Daily Expenses" / "နေ့စဉ်ကုန်ကျစရိတ်"
- `dashboard.totalExpenses` - "Total Expenses" / "စုစုပေါင်းကုန်ကျစရိတ်"

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Daily Sales Query
SELECT
  strftime('%d', s.created_at, 'localtime') as day,
  COALESCE(SUM(s.total), 0) as total_sales
FROM sales s
WHERE date(s.created_at, 'localtime') >= date(?)
  AND date(s.created_at, 'localtime') <= date(?)
GROUP BY strftime('%d', s.created_at, 'localtime')
ORDER BY day

-- Daily Expenses Query
SELECT
  strftime('%d', e.created_at, 'localtime') as day,
  COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0) as total_expenses
FROM expenses e
WHERE date(e.created_at, 'localtime') >= date(?)
  AND date(e.created_at, 'localtime') <= date(?)
GROUP BY strftime('%d', e.created_at, 'localtime')
ORDER BY day
```

### Chart Configuration

```typescript
<CustomBarChart
  data={{
    labels: dailySalesChart.labels, // ['1', '2', '3', ...]
    datasets: [{ data: dailySalesChart.data }], // [1500, 2300, 1800, ...]
  }}
  title="Daily Sales - October 2024"
  formatYLabel={(value) => formatPrice(parseFloat(value))}
  footer={{
    label: 'Total Sales',
    value: formatPrice(totalSales),
  }}
/>
```

### Data Processing

- Generates all days in current month (1-31 depending on month)
- Maps database results to day numbers
- Fills missing days with 0 values for complete visualization
- Calculates totals for footer display

## Benefits

### Business Insights

- ✅ **Daily Trends**: See which days have higher/lower sales and expenses
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition**: Identify weekly patterns or seasonal trends
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: Monitor daily business performance
- ✅ **Expense Control**: Track daily spending patterns

### User Experience

- ✅ **Visual Analytics**: Easy-to-understand bar charts
- ✅ **Current Month Focus**: Most relevant timeframe for daily operations
- ✅ **Complete Data**: Shows all days including zero-value days
- ✅ **Summary Information**: Footer totals provide quick overview

### Technical Benefits

- ✅ **Efficient Queries**: Optimized SQLite queries with proper indexing
- ✅ **Cached Data**: React Query caching reduces database calls
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Charts adapt to different screen sizes
- ✅ **Localized**: Supports multiple languages

## Usage

The charts automatically appear on the dashboard below the metric cards:

1. **Daily Sales Chart** - Shows revenue trends throughout the month
2. **Daily Expenses Chart** - Shows spending patterns throughout the month

Both charts include:

- Horizontal scrolling for months with many days
- Currency-formatted Y-axis labels
- Total values in the footer
- Responsive design for mobile devices

This implementation provides valuable daily insights while maintaining good performance and user experience.
